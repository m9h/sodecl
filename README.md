SODECL is a library of ordinary differential equation (ODE) and stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers in OpenCL. 
Using SODECL the user can calculate the integration orbits of a ODE or SDE system for a large number of different parameter values.

One example of the usefullness of SODECL is the fitting an ODE system representing a biological model to experimental data.  When optimising an ODE biological model using for example genetic algorithms the ODE model has to be calculated for a large number of different parameter values combinations. SODECL accelerates the calculation of these ODE model orbit integrations by taking advantage of all the cores of a CPU or the parallel capabilities of a GPU.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get the code you will need git. To install git on Ubuntu use the following commands in a terminal

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

To clone the repository from github use the following command in a terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/avramidis/sodecl.git
```
You will need pybind11, to clone the repository in the sodecl folder use the following commands in a terminal

```
cd sodecl
git submodule update --init
```

You will need lsb-core, to install it you the following command in a terminal

```
sudo apt install lsb-core
```

You will need the OpenCL Runtime for Intel Core and Intel Xeon Processors to run SODECL on an Intel CPU. The runtime can be downloaded from https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers#latest_CPU_runtime. In the folder with the downloaded tgz file use the following commands in a terminal

```
tar -zxvf l_opencl_p_18.1.0.014.tgz
cd l_opencl_p_18.1.0.014
sudo ./install_GUI.sh
```

You will need to install the OpenCL library. To do that use the following commands in a terminal

```
sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```

To generate the makefile for compiling SODECL you will need cmake. To install cmake on Ubuntu use the following command in a terminal

```
sudo apt install cmake
```

To use the Python wrapper a number of module must be installed. To install these modules use the following commands in a terminal

```
sudo apt install python3-numpy
sudo pip3 install numpy
sudo pip3 install matplotlib
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

To generate the makefiles use the following commands in a terminal in the sodecl folders

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

To build SODECL use the following command

```
make
```

To run an example using the Python wrapper use the following commands in a terminal the build directory


```
cd examples
python3 kuramoto_euler_stochastic.py
```

If the run was successful the output will be similar to the following

```
Compute results runtime: 0.0690873 sec.
Simulation execution time:  0.5892870426177979  seconds.
```

Using the following command in a terminal in the pythonwrapper directory the log generated by the SODECL run can be viewed

```
more sodecllog.txt
```

The output for a successful run should be similar too the following. The log file includes the OpenCL platforms and devices available in the system. Also, it includes the build options for the OpenCL kernel and the runtime.

```
The platform name is Intel(R) OpenCL
	The platform version is OpenCL 1.2 LINUX
	The device name is Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz
Selected platform name: Intel(R) OpenCL
Selected device name: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz
Selected device OpenCL version: OpenCL 1.2 (Build 37)
kernels/stochasticeuler.cl
Build options string: -I. -cl-fast-relaxed-math -cl-std=CL2.0 
The local group size is: 8
Compute results runtime: 0.0690873sec.
```
